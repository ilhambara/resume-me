    I started this project as a way of learning one of the <b>Ruby Gem</b> called <mark>Jekyll</mark> and it has grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you to make one.
