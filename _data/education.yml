    During my time at Eepis I learnt most of my key skills that I have taken such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thoroughly enjoyed my time as a student and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spend most of my time here to be an active member of the *PENS E-sport* and taking on roles such as *Contributor* or *Participant* to an *Open Source Projects* and also joined some *Coding Camp*.
